== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The social networking buttons do not direct to the links I provided? =
The links are supposed to be entered without the preceeding http://, for
instance if your facebook page URL is http://facebook.com/12345, simply enter
facebook.com/12345. This applies to all social networking links except for
Twitter, which requires only the username.
